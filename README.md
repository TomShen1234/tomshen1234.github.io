# Tom's Github Page

This page will be used to keep track of my apps and my projects! New apps will be added to the top.

## fpcode

`fpcode` is an app that allows you to create flowcharts and run them. It also supports generation of a trace table (ie. performing white-box testing).

## Codwpad

Codepad is a notepad app, but for storing codes. It supports some basic IDE features like syntax highlighting and auto-indent.

## PoemGame

This game allows you to practice your Chinese poem by selecting the correct box falling from the sky to fill in the train. 

## OCR Translator

This app allows you to take a picture of a text and it will translate it to another language. 

## TJPhotoEditor

My first app (still here for nostalgic purpose). Simple photo editor. 

## RocketStarCollector

My first SpriteKit game (still here for nostalgic purpose). Collect stars using your rocket and avoid bombs. 

Screenshots coming soon
