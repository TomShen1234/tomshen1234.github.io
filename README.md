# Tom's Github Page

This page will be used to keep track of my apps and my projects! New apps will be added to the top.

## My Apps

### [fpcode](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/fpcode/id1571134508?l=en&mt=12)

`fpcode` is an app that allows you to create flowcharts and run them. It also supports generation of a trace table (ie. performing white-box testing).

### [Codepad](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/codepad-code-notepad/id1551530363?l=en&mt=12)

Codepad is a notepad app, but for storing codes. It supports some basic IDE features like syntax highlighting and auto-indent.

### [PoemGame](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/codepad-code-notepad/id1551530363?l=en&mt=12)

This game allows you to practice your Chinese poem by selecting the correct box falling from the sky to fill in the train. 

### Requestable (WIP)

Simple HTTP client app for querying REST APIs. These contains features tailored specifically for my use case. This app is open sourced. ([View on Github](https://github.com/TomShen1234/Requestable))

**Note:** These are only my personal apps. Apps developed by a small team of mine for [my school (BCIS)](https://www.bcis.cn) can be found [here](https://easlink.bcis.cn). 

## Archived Apps

These apps are built by me while I'm still learning iOS/Swift development. They're made to practice my beginner coding skills. Now, there are replacements by big techs companies that are much more powerful and works much better. Therefore, these codes are open-sourced and archived on Github. I may or may not keep them updated. 

If the header links still works, that means the apps are still up on the App Store for download. 

### [OCR Translator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ocr-translator/id1143879812)

This app allows you to take a picture of a text and it will translate it to another language. ([View on Github](https://github.com/TomShen1234/ImageTextRecognizer))

### [TJPhotoEditor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tjphotoeditor/id976998242)

My first app. Simple photo editor. ([View on Github](https://github.com/TomShen1234/TJPhotoEditor))

### [RocketStarCollector](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rocket-stars-collector/id984957362)

My first SpriteKit game. Collect stars using your rocket and avoid bombs. This app is inspired by [Ray Wenderlich](https://www.raywenderlich.com)'s iOS Game By Tutorial. ([View on Github])(https://github.com/TomShen1234/CollectTheStars)

If you have any problem, you can contact me at tomshen2004 (at) icloud.com or send me a Twitter DM. Some apps are paid to support my development, but if you really want them for free, DM me as well (nicely) to get a promo code.
